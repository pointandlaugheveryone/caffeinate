            Hi!
            When I started learning programming, my caffeine addiction noticably intensified
            and because Im a student I want to save money ..that is like a global meme I guess.
            So, I got the idea to make this, and started it as my first web project (yes, with python.)

            Due to the annoying discount practices of retailers, the 'normal' price of things is always a sale of
            some kind, so the main point of this is to help out other caffeine enthusiasts save some Kč.
            More precisely those too lazy to search for the drink at <a href="https://kupi.cz" class="link">the website
              Im scraping from</a>

            you can check the code out <a href="https://github.com/pointandlaugheveryone/caffeinate"
              class="link">here</a>
