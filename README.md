### A web app to help caffeine addicts like me save money.
I created this to learn web dev, and didn't realize I have to eventually write the front-end too, so the html/css is a mess (sorry not sorry to the 2 people that are going to see this)

- Displays caffeinated drinks currently on sale in most popular czech grocery stores.
- filtering based on sugar content in case your lifestyle is not unhealthy enough :) (dark mode included)
- If you don't like javascript, you can safely look at this project, since I tried hard to avoid it.


**ORIGINAL CODE FOR PARSER CAN BE FOUND [here](https://github.com/prostmich/pykupi)**
- I plan on writing my own parser in the future since I had to do some edits to the original one to fix errors. That is also why the files are not there as a package. 


---
goals & TODO:
- [ ] write own parser
**columns/requires db update:**
- [ ] track amount of drinks as well (would break the current version)
- [ ] sale until [date] 
- separate site for k√°venky
