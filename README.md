#### A web app to help caffeine addicts like me save money.
<sub>I have contributed to the woeful wide web.</sub>

- Displays caffeinated drinks currently on sale in most popular czech grocery stores.
- filtering based on sugar content in case your lifestyle is not unhealthy enough :) (dark mode included)
- If you don't like javascript, you can safely look at this project, since I tried hard to avoid it.

**ORIGINAL CODE FOR PARSER CAN BE FOUND [HERE.](https://github.com/prostmich/pykupi)**
- I plan on writing my own parser in the future since I had to do some edits to the original one to fix errors. That is also why the files are not there as a package.
- I deleted the past repository with this project since I fucked up with venvs so bad its just sad (lost my two week streak with that :( )

---
goals & TODO:
- [ ] write own parser\
*columns/requires db update:*
- [x] track amount of drinks as well (would break the current version)
- [ ] sale until [date] 
- separate site for k√°venky
